### Prep work
**Learning objectives**
- understand what a matrix and a vector are and how to multiply matrices with vectors
- be able to represent a prediction equation in matrix notation
- understand, and interpret basic calculus relevant to a statistics context (e.g. limits, derivatives, integrals)

1. Watch [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jBhWQH9EkuW_-5eVDS39Ihww111NDzlm/view?usp=sharing) video on matrix algebra basics
2. Watch [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CVdm76wjxVYPUpsKKSOiKE0I8FeyKmY2/view?usp=sharing) video on calculus basics
3. Work through [these](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ucxbH85yNPNKLHNutEDZSalZRFRq9qtNJW-sKh39pr8/edit?usp=sharing) practice exercises for matrix algebra and calculus basics. Post any questions to the Slack channel #module5. Solutions will be posted to #module5 after the synchonorous session.
4. Brainstorm: What is one personal goal you have for this academic year? What is one grad-school-related goal you have for this academic year? Jot these down as a note to yourself; we will work with them during the synchronous session.
