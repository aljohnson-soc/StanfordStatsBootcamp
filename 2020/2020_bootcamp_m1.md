### Post-session work
**Learning objectives**
- use a .do file to write reproducible code.  
- begin to use functions to manipulate data (e.g. variable creation). 

Download the Stata self-directed handout [here](StataWorkshop_Self-directedhandout(public).pdf). Read through the handout and complete all the activities in a well-annotated do file. 
You can refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/LpF0OkuhdiI) to help you get started.
Submit your do file to the Bootcamp Slack #module1 channel. Make a note of any questions/concerns you have, or anything youâ€™d like feedback on.
