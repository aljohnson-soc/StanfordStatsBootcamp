### Prep work
1. Complete this [exercise on sampling distributions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hxeD31y_btFspS1k-fBan7M6y4WK4TdA/view?usp=sharing). Jot down a few notes to yourself as you complete the exercises.

### Synchronous session
**Learning objectives**
- explain the difference between a population distribution, sample distribution, and a sampling distribution
- tell a story in the scientific style using the concepts of “null hypothesis”, “repeated sampling”, and “statistical significance”

### Post-session work
**Learning objectives**
- explain the difference between a population distribution, sample distribution, and a sampling distribution
- compute exponents and logarithms

1. Read this [handout on sampling distributions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V1Xzfx9w3n0cp8uwuQultOAGhPNpqt1C/view?usp=sharing). This is essentially a review of content covered during the synchronous session, but it is very important conceptual information for statistics moving forward, so it can be helpful to go over it again in a different fashion! Post any questions to the Slack channel #module2. 
2. Read this [handout on exponents and logarithms](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exEMPATJOS4PIOpDBw-g2-EdCmvXhJxr/view?usp=sharing) and complete the exercises at the end of the document. While this may seem a bit tangential, exponential and logarithmic functions are very useful for modeling real-world applications (e.g. viral transmission) and have many applications in statistics. These exercises cover the mathematical properties of exponents and logarithms with the hope that you will be prepared to utilize them in their statistical applications in the future. Post any questions to the Slack channel #module2. Solutions will be posted to #module2 after the synchronous session.

The solutions to the exponents and logs exercises can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSckmoJUR0l2KzyPuaUEq9uz0qs7glQM/view?usp=sharing).
