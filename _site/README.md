Materials for the Stanford Sociology Department's Statistics Bootcamp, developed by PhD students [Amy L. Johnson](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/amyljohnson/home), [Rebecca Gleit](https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/rebecca-gleit), [Nick Sherefkin](https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/nick-sherefkin), and [Cat Sanchez](https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/catherine-sanchez).

The statistics bootcamp prepares incoming PhD students for the Sociology statistics sequence (Soc 381, 382, 383); this set of courses gives students a deep understanding of the most commonly used statistical techniques in social science. While the bootcamp is especially beneficial for students with nontraditional backgrounds or less quantitative experience, it is strongly recommended for all incoming graduate students to encourage a smooth transition into graduate studies and foster a friendly community of first-year social scientists. The bootcamp consists of five sessions with experienced graduate student instructors. During the bootcamp we develop our fluency in Stata (the statistical program used by many social scientists and throughout the sequence), review foundational mathematical and statistical concepts, and practice applications of core statistical ideas.

## Goals
1. Increase students’ understanding of and confidence with basic statistical concepts.
2. Build students’ programming intuition and data management skills.
3. Encourage collaboration and camaraderie among the graduate student cohort.

## About
The Statistics Bootcamp was originally developed in 2017 by then-PhD students [Emily Carian](https://www.csusb.edu/profile/emily.carian) and John Muñoz, and current PhD student Rebecca Gleit. It is funded by Stanford's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences ([IRiSS](https://iriss.stanford.edu/)).
